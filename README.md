## Fixed Bugs

This section outlines the bugs that were identified and resolved during the development of the project. Each bug is described along with the steps taken to fix it.

### Bug 1: Unwanted Messages Displayed on Contact Page

- **Symptoms:** After logging in or out and navigating to the contact page, unexpected login or logout-related messages were displayed, interfering with the intended success message.
- **Cause:** The global nature of Django's messaging framework was causing messages from the login and logout processes to appear on the contact page.
- **Resolution:**
  - Added the `extra_tags='contact-form'` parameter to the `messages.success` call in the view handling the contact form submission.
  - This additional tag ensures that the success message is specifically associated with the 'contact-form' namespace, preventing interference from other messages.
- **Testing:** Verified that, after the fix, only messages with the 'contact-form' tag are displayed upon navigating to the contact page after login or logout.

### Bug 2: Invalid Future Year Selection in Artwork Model

- **Symptons** Initially, an issue was identified in the Artwork model where administrators were able to select a future year in the `year_created` field, leading to inaccurate data and potentially causing confusion.
- **Cause:** The bug was rooted in the lack of validation for the `year_created` field, allowing admins to input any year without restriction.
- **Resolution:**
   - Implemented custom validation in the save method of the Artwork model.
   - The save method now checks if the `year_created` exceeds the current year, and if so, raises a ValidationError preventing the save operation.
    Code Fix:
```
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    current_year = timezone.now().year
    if self.year_created > current_year:
        raise ValidationError("Year created cannot exceed the current year.")
    super(Artwork, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
```
- **Testing:** After the implementation, attempting to save an artwork with a future year results in a clear validation error message, ensuring data accuracy.

### Bug 3: Slug and Pathway Confusion in Artwork Detail Page

- **Symptons**
   - Inconsistencies in the display of the comments section on the Artwork Detail page came from errors arising due to the use of both integer and slug pathways in the URLs.
- **Cause:**
   - The Artwork Detail page initially employed a combination of integer and slug-based URLs, leading to confusion in the interpretation of pathways.
   - The comments section was specifically tied to the integer-based pathway, causing it to be inaccessible when using slug-based URLs.
- **Resolution:**
   - URL Modification: Updated the URLs for the Artwork Detail page to use slugs exclusively and removed integer-based pathways to eliminate conflicts and ensure consistency.
   - Link Updates: Revised all links pointing to the Artwork Detail page to reflect the new slug-based URLs.
- **Testing:**
   - Conducted extensive testing to ensure the comments section appeared consistently on the Artwork Detail page.
   - Verified proper navigation and resolved any errors related to the slug and pathway modifications.
   
### Bug 4: Inaccurate Artwork Search Results
- **Symptons**
   - The initial implementation of the search functionality on the Artwork page was searching for the artwork title, medium, and description.
   - Despite attempts to modify the JavaScript for more focused searches on the artist, the search continued to include the entire artwork description.
   - This led to excessive and less user-friendly search results due to the lengthy nature of artwork descriptions.
- **Cause:**
   - The discrepancy was identified in the `views.py` file, where the search query was still configured to include the artwork description.
- **Resolution:**
   - Modified the search_view function in `views.py` to prioritize searching for the artist (`artist__icontains`) instead of the description (`description__icontains`).
```
def search_view(request):
    query = request.GET.get('q', '')
    artworks = Artwork.objects.all()

    if query:
        artworks = artworks.filter(
            Q(title__icontains=query) |
            Q(medium__icontains=query) |
            Q(artist__icontains=query)
        )

    context = {
        'artworks': artworks,
        'search_query': query,
    }
    return render(request, 'gallery.html', context)
```
- **Testing:**
   - Conducted search tests to verify that the search functionality now focuses on the artwork title, medium, and artist, omitting the description.
   - Ensured that search results align with the desired user-friendly experience.
